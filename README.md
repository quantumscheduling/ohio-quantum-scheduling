Currently, this is in an alpha stage to just show the concept.

The point of this program is to have a user-friendly way to do scheduling in an organization. A hope is that AI will be able to read text that's input into the system, for example if someone reports that someone is sick for the day, and update the schedule as needed. This particular program is focused on the state of Ohio, and can serve as a use case. For example, Ohio's state constitution currently stipulates that every year the minimum wage for a certain subset of workers has to go up by the rate of inflation every January 1st. As of the first alpha release of this program, the rate of inflation is not set and is just an estimate that can be put in as needed. That feature is likely to be amended in the future.

Also in the future, there will hopefully be a version that can be more broadly applied. However, this project is based out of Ohio, and this could be a good use case before a more generalized version is released.

This is a work in progress.
