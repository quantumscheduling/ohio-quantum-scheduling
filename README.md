Currently, this is in an alpha stage to just show the concept.

The point of this program is to have a user-friendly way to do scheduling in an organization. A hope is that AI will be able to read text that's input into the system, for example if someone reports that someone is sick for the day, and update the schedule as needed.

This is a work in progress.
